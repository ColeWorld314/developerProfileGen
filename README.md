# developerProfileGen

I have created a Profile generator using node js via the command line Terminal.

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application will be invoked with the following command:
node index.js
The user will be prompted for a favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards.
The PDF will be populated with the following:

Profile image: "RosieAndIProfPic.jpg
User name; ColeWorld314
Links to the following:

User location via Google Maps: N/A yet
User GitHub profile:N/A yet
User blog: N/A


User bio: In my responsive portfolio
Number of public repositories: 12
Number of followers: 0
Number of GitHub stars: 1
Number of users following: 0

Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:

AS A product manager

I WANT a developer profile generator

SO THAT I can easily prepare reports for stakeholders
Refer to the design mockup.

Business Context
When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.
